==Legal History ==
===Closed Cases===

====Lyoness vs. ACCC====
In Australia, The Competition and Consumer Commission ([[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|ACCC]]), after researching Lyoness for a while, instituted proceedings against Lyoness International AG, Lyoness Asia Limited, Lyoness UK Limited and Lyoness Australia Pty Limited (together ‘Lyoness’) for operating a pyramid selling scheme and engaging in referral selling.<ref name="accc.gov.au"/><ref name="accc.gov.au"/><ref name="news.com.au"/> The ACCC alleges that Lyoness has operated the scheme in Australia from mid-2011 and that it continues to operate the scheme. The scheme offers ‘cash back’ rebates to members who shop through a Lyoness portal, use Lyoness vouchers or present their Lyoness card at certain retailers.  Whilst cash back offers themselves are not prohibited by the Australian Consumer Law, the ACCC alleges that the Lyoness scheme also offers commissions to members who recruit new members who make a down payment on future shopping. The ACCC is seeking declarations, pecuniary penalties, injunctions, an order requiring the Lyoness website to link to the case report and costs. As Lyoness International AG, Lyoness Asia Limited and Lyoness UK Limited are located overseas, the ACCC will be making arrangements for service on those entities.  The case is before Justice Flick of the Federal Court in Sydney.<ref>[http://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-takes-action-against-alleged-pyramid-scheme-operator  “Lyoness: ACCC takes action against alleged pyramid scheme operator”], “ACCC Website and Media Release”, 28 August 2014</ref> Lyoness have submitted their defence in October 2014, and the next hearing will be in February 2015.<ref name="news.com.au"/> Australian victims claim to have lost thousands of dollars each to Lyoness.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-15/shopping-network-lyoness-vows-to-defend-accc-court-action/5744880 “Shopping Network Lyoness Accused of Running Pyramid Scheme"]</ref> 
Lyoness was ruled not guilty on both counts (pyramid scheme and referral selling)

====Norway====
In December 2013, Norwegian authorities announced a full investigation of Lyoness on the suspicion of it operating an illegal pyramid scheme.<ref name="Lottstift1"/><ref name="Behind1"/> Lyoness received 3 weeks to respond to the announcement.<ref>[https://lottstift.no/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/13-06752-1-Tilsynssak-pyramidespill-Krav-om-dokumentasjon-om-virksomheten-til-Lyoness-i-Norge-755415_6_0.pdf  "Tilsynssak pyramidespill - krav om dokumentasjon om virksomheten til Lyoness i Norge"]</ref> Following an investigation of several months, the Norwegian Gaming Board concluded that Lyoness operated an illegal pyramid scheme in Norway in 2012 and 2013. After the investigation had been announced, in 2014, less than the legal barrier of 50% (43%) of Lyoness's revenue in Norway derived from recruiting, making them eligible to continue operation under Norwegian law.  

Lyoness operates legally in Norway as of Oct 2015.

===Open Cases===
In the meantime, Austrian authorities have started investigations of the Lyoness business model and the related allegations that the company is running an illegal pyramid scheme.<ref name="derstandard1"/> Criminal investigations in Austria have been concluded by the Austrian Economic and Corruption Prosecutor ("WKStA"), who maintains that Lyoness operates an illegal [[pyramid scheme]].<ref name="Kleine Zeitung"/><ref>[http://steiermark.orf.at/news/stories/2728632/ “ORF”], “ORF: Lyoness investigation concluded”, August 27, 2015</ref> Lyoness expects to be cleared of all charges.<ref name="Tiroler Tageszeitung"/>

Outside of its homecountries, Lyoness has also been confronted with scrutiny from authorities. Reportedly, similar investigations were started in Hungary;<ref name="gvh.hu"/> Norway;<ref name="Lottstift"/><ref name="Lottstift1">[https://lottstift.no/blog/2013/12/09/lotteritilsynet-skal-vurdere-lyoness/ "Lotteritilsynet skal vurdere Lyoness"]</ref><ref name="Behind1">[http://behindmlm.com/companies/lyoness/norway-launch-lyoness-pyramid-investigation/ "Norway Launch Lyoness Pyramid Investigation"]</ref> Poland;<ref name="Gaz1">[http://prawo.gazetaprawna.pl/artykuly/775886,program-lojalnosciowy-moze-byc-przykrywka-dla-piramidy-finansowej-jak-nie-dac-sie-oszukac.html/ "Program lojalnościowy może być przykrywką dla piramidy finansowej.

In Hungary, Lyoness was fined by the authorities for illegal advertising.<ref name="gvh.hu"/> In Poland, the OCCP called Lyoness a pyramid scheme, but the current status of the investigation is unknown.<ref name="Gaz1"/><ref name="behindmlm.com"/> In Sweden, the responsible authority concluded that Lyoness is a pyramid scheme and reported Lyoness to the Stockholm police.<ref name="lotteriinspektionen.se"/> While initially halted, an appeal by the Gaming Board led to a continuation of the investigation by the Stockholm Police.<ref name="lotteriinspektionen.se2"/>

In Greece, an arrest warrant was issued in August 2015 against the Austrian directors of Lyoness Greece. On the 10th of August 2015 the Prosecutor of Thessaloniki Court of First Instance issued an arrest warrant against Herbert Teissel and his wife Anna Teissel, alleged directors of Lyoness Greece, for attempted fraud.<ref name="News247"/><ref name="ReferenceC"/> Lyoness vehemently denies all allegations.
